  <h3>ABOUT PANG</h3>
  <p><em>Our mission</em></p>

  <p>Pang is a message board for restaurants who wish to help hungry people in need. Restaurants that have leftover but safe-to-eat food can post Pang updates using a verified gmail account to inform the hungry of times they can pick up excess food. </p>
  <p>This solution means that restaurants produce less waste, and fewer people go hungry. It’s a win-win situation! Pang does not profit off of these interactions, we merely seek to promote social good.</p>

      <br>
      <p>The USDA has been working on a way to get business to reduce their amount of food loss by having 3 program: U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions, Food Recovery Challenge and U.S Food Waste Challenge.

      <br>
      <p>Huffington Post sources found that farmers themselves know that food is being discarded only due to the appearance. For instance, the article stated ‘ A cucumber farmer estimated that fewer than half the vegetables he grows actually leave his farm and that 75 percent of them removed before sale are edible.
